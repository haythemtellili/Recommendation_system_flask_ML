# Recommender_system_flask_app

In this repository we will be learning how to build a simple Recommendation system for movies with Flask 
and deploy it to production using Heroku.

To Build our engine we used the Collaborative filtering methods that are based solely on the past interactions recorded between users and items in order to produce new recommendations.
These interactions are stored in the so-called “user-item interactions matrix” then we apply Cosine similarity.
